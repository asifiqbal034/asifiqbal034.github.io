<p><h3> My hobby is playing cricket . Cricket is my favorite sport . When I get some free time after my studies ,I go outside to the ground with my friends and play cricket .
cricket is the game which requires physical fitness .So,after playing cricket when I study, I can better grab the concepts.
I also become delighted by playing cricket because I don't waste my mind sitting in front of a computer or playing video games . Instead ,I do some healthy activity .
On every friday evening , I have three or four hours free . Mostly, I play cricket at that time . I have purchase my cricket kit . I also got another benefit of being a player of cricket . My skills of playing cricket have been increased ,and i have been selected in my team .
Although I love my hobby , it is on more than my study .I do my study first and then and I enjoy myself with a Hobbies.
